This project is a basic 3d walking sim in a small terrain within unity. To run open the files within UnityProjectFiles with unity.
I used unity editor version 2020.3.33f1 to create the project and run it. It is also posted to my CIS 367 Project Webpage: https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~mumac/
The webGL version that is on the website does not load in the water shader for some reason, so it will just appear as a black plane.
It also seems to be considerably slower when running on webGL.
For the video, it is the same video that is within my presentation. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKdCcT8nk-A&ab_channel=ConnorMuma
